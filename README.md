Our website encompasses five distinct pages: Home, Departures, Arrivals, Operations, and Employees. <br>
Each page features a consistent header showcasing navigation options to swiftly access the other sections.
The Home page serves as the main hub, featuring the header and intuitive search boxes facilitating easy flight searches.
 Meanwhile, the Departures and Arrivals pages showcase a comprehensive list comprising of incoming and outcoming flights as well as info regarding flight numbers, destinations, departure times, and statuses, etc. <br>

Similarily, the Arrivals page mirrors the Departures layout but focuses on incoming flights, displaying relevant details such as flight numbers, origins, arrival times, and statuses. This page also includes a search bar, enhancing the ease of finding specific arrival information.
The Operations page serves as a comprehensive overview of all ongoing airport operations, offering insights into current activities and functions in progress. It provides a centralized space to monitor and understand the operational status of various airport functionalities.
Throughout the website, users can navigate seamlessly between these sections, ensuring a user-friendly experience and easy access to essential flight and operational information.
